title: Upscaling to Network

# Background

In our last module we will provide examples of how network scale models of component of fish habitat are used to describe spatially explicit estimates of fish abundance resolved at the reach level across the entire network.  Reach scale information was used to validate and often to parameterize the network information.  We provide two examples of how abundance estimates can be incorporated into a life-cycle model to evaluate changes to fish habitat through restoration or climate change.

### Can upscaling approaches describe fish habitat and abundance?
In this lecture, we recap a study where river styles was validated and used to describe fish habitat. When coupled with GPP, reach type was able to predict fish abundance better than typical multivariate approaches.

### Upscaling fish abundance- Part 2
We provide first an example of using the relationship between NREI fish placement and capacity estimates with geomorphic units described by GUT. This is extrapolated across the  Asotin steelhead major population group watersheds to predict changes in fish abundance due to restoration. The second example is a quick recap of the Justice et al. 2017 and Weber et al. 2018 readings.

### Upscaling fish abundance- Part 3
The last example is how we used ecohydraulic models to describe current and expected impacts to capacity and survival, upscale this to the Middle Fork John Day network, and use this information in a life-cycle model to evaluate alternative restoration scenarios.
