# Background

We need a basic understanding of fluvial hydraulics for the purposes of how they define physical habitat for fish. For this lecture we really need to understand just enough physics (well fluid mechanics really) to be dangerous enough to interpret where the characterization of hydraulic habitat (i.e., velocity and depth patterns) occurs and how it matters to fish. Normally, to get to the point of running hydraulic models (likely as a senior in a civil engineering program) you would traditionally need the following prerequisites before being able to take a "Hydraulics" or "Open Channel Flow" class where you might run a one-dimensional hydraulic model:
- Fluid Mechanics, which typically requires prerequisties of:
  - Statics &  Dynamics, which require prerequisites of:
    - Physics (Mechanics) - Understand force balances (i.e. hydraulics as a driving forces and resisting forces problem)
    - Differential Equations & Linear Algebra (i.e., Advanced Calculus) to follow the derivations of equations of motion and solve systems of equations    

And even then, you probably still would not be taught how to run a two-dimensional or three-dimensional hydraulic model (as are now typically used in ecohydraulics). Since most of you do not have three years to take all these courses, we will do a really rough treatment to get you the basics. 

In the same way that you might describe the weather based on measures of precipitation and temperature (with climate descrbing long-term tendencies and paterns), in open channel flow (i.e. a free surface as opposed to pressurized flow in pipes) treatments hydraulics we can define aquatic habitat based on measures of flow fields of velocity vectors and spatial paterns of water depth.

## Lecture & Slides

I have a similar problem in my [WATS 5150 - Fluvial Geomorphology](https://riverscapes.github.io/Fluvial-Geomorphology/) class where most students need to understand hydraulics for its application to understanding the topic at hand - in that case fluvial geomorphology.  I present a similarly distilled version of hydraulics there. In Fluvial Geomorphology [Module 5](https://riverscapes.github.io/Fluvial-Geomorphology/Course_Topics/module-05) a very geomorphic-centric coverage of hydraulics is provided. That is, in the same way here we are interested in hydraulics for what it means to provision of aquatic habitat for biota, in that treatment we are interested in how that governs the fluid motion from the perspective of what can do geomorphic work.  Here I use a different set-up (i.e., intro), but the same core treatment of the subject.

### Introductory Treatments of Hydraulics

#### "The Flow" from Wilcock et al. (2009) Sediment Transport Primer
In Wilcock et al.'s (2009) treatment of "The Flow" on pages 20-24 is a nice, approachable, concise and traditional treatment of one-dimensional hydraulics:

#### Chapter Five from "Geomorphic Analysis of River Systems"

Skim [Chapter 5](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.dist.lib.usu.edu/lib/usu/reader.action?docID=1032536&ppg=81)   of Fryirs & Brierley (2013) on "Impelling and Resisting Forces in River Systems", which some of you will have already read from Fluvial Geomorphology.

Some geese surfing the Glenwood wave... they're clearly reading hydraulics just to have fun:
