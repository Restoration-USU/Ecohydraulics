# Background

Food and temperature are vital components of fish habitat. Bioenergetics models are widely use to evaluate how food, temperature, activity, diet, & fish size affect growth rates of fishes.  We provide enough background here to allow you to understand and operate a bioenergetics model to evaluate factors affecting growth which is often used as surrogate to fitness.
