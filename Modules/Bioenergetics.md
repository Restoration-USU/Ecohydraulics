title: Bioenergetic Models for Fish
weight: 6
---

# Background
Several approaches have been used to understand and model fish habitat relationships. Here I provide a brief introduction to some of those approaches and to associated terminology.  I then suggest alternatives to Habitat Suitability models that we are going to explore in later lectures that include other vital components of fish habitat such as food and temperature. The next lecture introduces bioenergetics models which are widely use to evaluate how food, temperature, activity, diet, & fish size affect growth rates of fishes.  We provide enough background here to allow you to understand and operate a bioenergetics model to evaluate factors affecting growth which is often used as surrogate to fitness.
