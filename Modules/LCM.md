title: Fish Life Cycle Modeling
weight: 13

# Background

We are going to describe some simple life-cycle models that can be used to put current management and propose actions to expected fish responses into the context of their population dynamics, management goals (e.g. recovery criteria) and extinction probabilities.

# Resources
This first lecture is an introduction to salmon and steelhead life-cycles and management complexities that highlight the need for some sort of accounting methods as to the impacts these various actions have during different life-stages relative to what we might be proposing. A life-cycle modeling approach is how we often attempt to quantify these responses.
