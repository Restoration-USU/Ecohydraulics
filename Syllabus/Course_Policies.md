### Academic Freedom and Professional Responsibilities (Faculty Code)

Academic freedom protects the rights of faculty members in teaching and of students in learning. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in teaching, research, and creative activities,subject to the limitations imposed by professional responsibility. Faculty [CodePolicy 403](https://www.usu.edu/policies/403/) further defines academic freedom and professional responsibilities.
