title: Management & Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems Capstone Course
---


# Course Overview

We extend a warm welcome to all students enrolled in [WATS/CEWA 6840 - Ecohydraulics](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/580268) at Utah State University. While this site primarily serves our registered students, we've curated resources that hold value for a more extensive ecosystem management and restoration community. This includes practitioners, managers, stakeholders, and researchers alike.

In earlier iterations of this course, the curriculum was structured as a blend of fluvial hydraulics and ecohydraulics, with a heavier focus on fluvial hydraulics. However, the field of Ecohydraulics has evolved significantly since then, marking a significant milestone in the realm of aquatic science and ecosystem management. The emergence of pivotal textbooks such as "Ecohydraulics" by Pasternack (2011) and "Ecohydraulics: An Integrated Approach" by Maddock et al. (2013), along with the establishment of the[ Journal of Ecohydraulics](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tjoe20/current) was established (Kemp & Katopodis, [2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/24705357.2016.1259139)), and the biennial convening of the [International Symposium of Ecohydraulics](https://symposium.inrae.fr/ise2020), now in its 12th iteration, bear testament to the vibrant and dynamic nature of this field.

*This class is offered every alternate spring, with the next planned sessions for Spring 2024 and 2026. We understand that this schedule may not align with everyone's availability. For students whose timelines do not coincide with our regular offerings, we offer the flexibility to access our online  [online lectures]({{ site.baseurl }}/Modules/) and assignments, allowing you to engage in self-paced study.*

## Organization of *this* Course
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pics/Scale.png"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pics/Scale200.png"></a>
As we designed this graduate course within the [Department of Watershed Sciences](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/index), we took into consideration our diverse audience of students, each coming from distinct academic backgrounds:

- **Ecologists** and **Fisheries Biologists** : Many of our students within the department may not have a strong foundation in hydraulics, open-channel flow, physics, calculus, or fluvial geomorphology.
-  **Hydrologists** and **Geomorphologists** : Some students joining our course might excel in hydrology and geomorphology but may have limited exposure to fisheries and ecology.
-  **[Civil Engineers](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/)** : We also welcome civil engineers with a background in hydraulics and fluid mechanics. However, their exposure to fluvial hydraulics in natural systems, as well as their background in biology and ecology, may be limited.

We were worried about focusing on developing specific and narrow skillsets  in running hydraulic models to drive ecohydraulic models, and giving students lots of experience in just a few specific flavor of ecohydraulic models that are typically used to look at fish habitat at reach-scales (e.g. resolving habitat at scale fish use it, but only spanning a reach). We decided instead to focus on a specific example that would expose students to the broader management and ecological questions of managing fish populations through studying their habitat (i.e. ecohydraulics). We felt this would expose students to a broader swath of concepts and literature, while giving some experience interpreting and running a large diversity of model types from different disciplines necessary to address a population-scale question, while leveraging the mechanistic insights of what are typically finer-scale lines of inquiry in ecohydraulics.
