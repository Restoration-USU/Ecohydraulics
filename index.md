title: Management & Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems Capstone Course
---


# Course Overview

Welcome to the Ecohydraulics Course Website! The primary audience for this site are the students enrolled in [WATS 6900 - Ecohyraulics](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/580268) at Utah State University. However, the resources found here may be of general interest to a broader ecosystem management and restoration community, including practitioners, managers, stakeholders and researchers. 

In [past versions of this class](http://fluvial.joewheaton.org) it was taught as a fluvial hydraulics and ecohydraulic course, with a stronger emphasis on fluvial hydraulics. Since then, multiple textbooks on Ecohydraulics have been published (Pasternack 2011; Maddock et al. 2013) & , the [ Journal of Ecohydraulics](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tjoe20/current) was established (Kemp & Katopodis, [2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/24705357.2016.1259139)), and the [International Symposium of Ecohydraulics](https://symposium.inrae.fr/ise2020) has met for the 12th time!

## Organization of *this* Course
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pics/Scale.png"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pics/Scale200.png"></a>
When reflecting on what to cover in *this* graduate course in the [Department of Watershed Sciences](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/index) we knew we'd be targeting a mixed audience of students including:
- **ecologists** and **fisheries biologists** in our own department with little of the requisite background in hydraulics, open-channel flow, physics, calculus and/or fluvial geomorphology, as well as:
-  **hydrologists** and **geomorphologists**, with little background in fisheries and/or ecology, as well as:
-  **[civil engineers](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/)** with background in hydraulics and fluid mechanics, but maybe limited exposure to fluvial hydraulics in natural systems and lacking background in biology and ecology

We were worried about focusing on developing specific and narrow skillsets  in running hydraulic models to drive ecohydraulic models, and giving students lots of experience in just a few specific flavor of ecohydraulic models that are typically used to look at fish habitat at reach-scales (e.g. resolving habitat at scale fish use it, but only spanning a reach). We decided instead to focus on a specific example that would expose students to the broader management and ecological questions of managing fish populations through studying their habitat (i.e. ecohydraulics). We felt this would expose students to a broader swath of concepts and literature, while giving some experience interpreting and running a large diversity of model types from different disciplines necessary to address a population-scale question, while leveraging the mechanistic insights of what are typically finer-scale lines of inquiry in ecohydraulics.
